# Hotel Room Booking

## Introduction

This project implements a Hotel Room Booking system that allows users to browse available hotel rooms, book rooms for specific dates, and manage bookings. It’s built in Python (with a Jupyter Notebook and a standalone Python script) and offers a simple, fully functioning booking workflow.

The goal is to provide a self-contained application to demonstrate core booking logic, data handling, and user interaction, suitable for learning or extension into a more full-featured system.

## Features

* Browse available hotel rooms and view their details (room type, price, availability)
* Select check-in and check-out dates and book a room
* Handle booking constraints (e.g., availability, overlapping bookings)
* Simple user interface via notebook and script
* Data storage and retrieval logic (could be extended to a database)
* Easy to modify and extend (e.g., add payment integration, user auth)

## Technology Stack

* Python – Core programming language
* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) – Interactive demonstration of booking logic
* Standalone Python Script (.py) – Command-line version of the system
